# AirlineReservationSystem
This Airline Reservations System is a small program that assigns seats on the airline's single plane's flights (capacity: 10 seats). Because the first 5 seats are in the smoking section and whileÂ the remaining 5 seats are in the non-smoking section, the user has the option of either reserving a seat or having the system do it at random.
